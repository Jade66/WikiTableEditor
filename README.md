# WikiTableEditor
A quick-and-dirty wiki table editor for certain flavors of wiki.

This is a Chrome packaged app, which allows primitive editing of wiki table content within a spreadsheet-like table.  It is primarily useful when you have a table with more than a few columns, where it can be hard to tell what row/column you are in.

To use:

1) If editing an existing table, edit the wiki page, copy the table markup and paste it into the editor's text area.  This will generate a table above.
2) Make your data changes in the table.  You can tab between fields, and use the buttons to add rows or columns.  You cannot remove rows or columns.
3) Your edits are immediately reflected in the markup, so when you are done, just copy the contents of the text area and paste them back into the wiki editor.
4) Preview your changes before saving.
